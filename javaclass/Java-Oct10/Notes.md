# Class Notes - Java Intro

## Logistics
- Class hours 9-5 
- Lunch 12-1 
- two 15 breaks 
- If you know you're going to be late - let me know
- Class repository
    - Updated daily
    - Includes these notes
    - All the class LQ materials
    - And demo code written during class
## Software Setup
- Java JDK/SDK version 12+
- Maven 
- IDE 
    - Eclipse 
    - Jetbrains IntelliJ
    - Visual Studio Code

## Introductions
- Name preferred 
- What is your area expertise 
- Your Java experience or other programming lang
- What you want to learn 

###
- Java Language - language features 
- Code design - OOAD, software craftsmanship
- Coding practice - dev practices - TDD

## Java Syntax
- use of ";" to indicate of statements

## Java Model
- Not open source Java
- Publish a Java spec - describe how JAva should
- Let create a "java language and Jvm"
- Trademark and copyright the bejezus out it
- Implemented a reference implements

## Arrays
- They are FAST!!
- They are fixed - all elements to be continguous in memory
- All elements are the same size
- Constant time lookup
- (startingaddress) * n * element

## Java Rules
1. Don't rely on implicit conversion in mixed mode arithmetic
2. Avoid using bitwise operations
3. Don't rely on implicit order of operations
4. Don't use the i*= j form

## Lexical scope of a variable 

break - stop the loop now and get out of the loop
continue - stop the current iteration and start the next iteration

## package naming

DRY = DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF!!!

s.speak

s {
    object -> Dog object
    swim  -> swim method in the dog objec
}

- Currencies


# Class resumes at 2pm

1/9 = .11111
1 = 9 * 1/9 = .99999999

## Errors / bug / fault
- Mistakes in our code
- Errors go away we fix the code

## Exceptions
- Failures in the environment our programming is running
- exceptions are handeled - shut down the program or take a remedial actions

## Must know tech

1. Maven
2. Spring
